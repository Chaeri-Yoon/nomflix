- [ ] When mouse is hovering on the content for a certain seconds, it will show modal with information on that content and play a trailer automatically like Netflix.
- [ ] Add query field to the url of search results so that the application can remember the lastest keyword when the website is directed to the search results from the content detail page.
- [ ] Use redux to reduce the number of api requests
